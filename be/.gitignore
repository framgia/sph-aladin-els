# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
be/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
be/log/*
be/tmp/*
!/log/.keep

betmp/pids/*
!/tmp/pids/
!/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
be/storage/*
!/storage/.keep
be/tmp/storage/*
!/tmp/storage/
